Ok, let us ignore the fonts and the ui colours for now. Will be improved with the upcoming design.

Any suggestions to clarify this options in the pop up or the pop up itself? May be other users will run in the same problem.

Ahh, ok, NEW is a wrong caption. (the function of the "NEW" button is "SAVE AS").

Ok, just to be clear: remove the "do you like to save" pop up
Add a button "INIT SOUNDLOAD"
Rename: NEW to SAVE AS

Ok, I'll add these settings. Thanks!

Ok, these points I'll study in detail today evening.
Thanks for that input!

No, it's good. I need this input to create a good instrument!
Thank you!
