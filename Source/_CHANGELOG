CHANGES 0.5:
- add: more speed multies (1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,12,16)
- replace: speed multi buttons with a slider
- add: multi core support
- improve: performance (reduce cpu usage, reduce memory usage)
- add: crackl free filter switch (if you switch e.g. from LP to HP there are working for a short time a LP and a HP filter in a mix)
- fix: engine crashs (mostly on switch programs)
- fix: peak meter crashs
- add: octave offset
- improve: ui sliders, clean it up (and resize)
- change path to monique (please rename your folder)
- fix: oscilloscope repaint lag/bug
- add: store oscilloscope settings withg program
- fix: slider bg was not correct for some slider
- change: modulation slider from -100% to 100 are now fixed in the center (maybe we loos a bit of self explaining, but it is more clear if the front slider is on min or max)
- clean and move the subeditors to the bottom (like the osci)
- remove: max attack, decay, sus, release times in ADR preset editor (to simplify)
- change: ADR preset setting are now in the new editor "ADR"
- add cpu usage and multicore options to "CFG" editor
- add select audio card and driver (standalone)
- add: double click on the morph pad resets it to the center (center == all morph sliders set to zero or LEFT side)
- fix: resize editors on main ui size change
- chnaged the ADSR preset MAX times to 10s (10000ms) and removed the max sliders
- release the synth if inactive
- handle note inputs correclty (was something wrong and bundled with the arp)
- add minimum attack and release time to avoid cracls
- fix shape crackls
- fix eq crackls
- back to mono output
- refactoring of eq (more boost)
- more gain
- move window buttons on mac to the left side
- add force amp to zero option (can be force some kicking effects)
- fix/add some missing morph parameters
- set min morph motor time to 20ms
- fix can crash on short attack time (coz we have a min value of 30ms)
- multi instance support should be fixed (but was no time to check it in detail yet - can anybody do this?)
- fix crash on short morph motor time
- shift phase of the 32.5hertz band
- fix crackls on filter input switch from amp to fix or in the other direction
- fix 95% of the crackls on program switches
- fix disable lfo animation if modulation animations is disabled
- change modulation button light (brighter) if animation modulations is turned of
- global settings will be stored to an own file. It will be read on app start and stored on shutdown
- fix problem that the synth not each time sonds like last time :D
- remove 2pass filter (it's all 2pass not, play around with the gain, this there is the 1 pass hidden behind.
- improved high pass filter and rasonance of all filters
- labels for adsr slider are editable now
- ADSR labels show now the real range value and the caption is changed to range
- fix cracksl on switch cutoff, gain, resonance, filter volume, distortion to modulated or modulated off

:!: KNOWN BUGS:
- buggy manual morph if auto morph is running -> stop auto morph on manual morph
- filter out volume crackls!! ---> also the filter modulation buttons!
- turn chorus amp on off crackls
- do not process the unused bands
set from current updated the morph group
- bug: osc 2 and 3 sync problem if they run on the same frequency like the first one
- kein background value für linear slider
- osc square and saw going out of center on higher octaves
- file remove is buggy


TODO:
- test performance HeapBlock on the stack vs array of floats
- add arrow up/down, left/right to control slider values
- add: store ui size
- add: modulation amounts as automation params
- add: midi bank select
- add: midi mod wheel; pitch wheel support
- add: panic
- add-back: morph toggles
- shuffle: snap to note durations
- improve/fix style of some background sliders: e.g modulation of the OSC tune
- fix colour styles for some sub editors
- add: modwheel to ui
- store last programm as filename in last session file (not as sepperate project)
- bg für second ADSR slider
- auto resize ui if screen is to small
- todo: check colours global, save colours
- add 3 standard colour themes
- reset oscs to zero
- chorus effect (also dieser buffer fill block) muss von der samplerate abhängen

QUESTS
- sync lfo with note on?
- how to set return value?
- should have buttons which enables ADSR preset curves have an own colour?
